Overview of PhD code

## PhD Title:  Diabatic Eddies in idealised channel models ##

This work used the MITgcm to simulate over 40 different experiments of idealised channel models altering the northern boundary condition. This repository gives an overview of the code used for this work.

1. **MITgcm template setup**
    * This is a template of channel model set up, input files, header files, optimization, job submission.

2. **NetCDF manipulation**
    * A large amount of data is generated and this must be layed out in a senisble matter

3. **Python modules for analysis of MITgcm output**
    * Custom base modules.

4. **Ipython Notebooks**
    * For plotting and bespoke caculations.
